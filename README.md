### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Discusser and I program for fun. I'm still in high school but I plan on studying computer science later.
I know various languages (such as C++, Rust, JavaScript, Python...) and I'm always trying to learn something new. With all these languages I've developped websites, applications, and scripts, you can find some of them on my [website](https://discusser.github.io/)
